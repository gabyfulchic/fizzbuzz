# FizzBuzz
*Made around the Test Driven Development course.*


## Rules
  
```ruby
- we write tests verifying the output we want
- we execute them without to function to test if the code well fail
- we write fonction to be tested
- we execute tests and want GREEN return
- then finally we REFACTO the code to make it cleaner and more efficient
```

## ToDo  
  
```ruby
- one commit by action (RED | GREEN | REFACTOR)
```

## 
```python
py tests.py && py main.py
```
